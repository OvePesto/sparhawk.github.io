Pilot watches are designed to assist pilots in navigating and tracking time during flight. They are typically characterized by a distinctive style including bright faces, bold numerals and markers, and often a large crown for easy adjustments. They also usually feature a chronograph for time measurement, as well as a rotating bezel to help keep track of elapsed time more easily. Pilot watches are highly durable and designed to withstand the harsh environment of flying missions.
