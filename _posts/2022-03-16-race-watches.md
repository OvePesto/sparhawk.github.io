Race watches are designed to help you track your performance. They can be used to measure distance and elapsed time, see your average and maximum speed, and in some cases even your heart rate while youâ€™re on the track. They come in a range of styles, sizes, and features so you can choose the best one for your needs. Plus, many race watches are water-resistant, making them perfect for swim meets and other wet conditions.
